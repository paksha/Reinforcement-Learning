### What is AI?

- Artificial intelligence is any algorithm to enable computers to perform actions we define as requiring intelligence (says Mark)

- GOFAI --> Logical rules, planning, search
- Evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms for example)
- Reasoning about probabilities
- Computer Vision, NLP, ML
- Robotics
- Decision Making (Reinforcement Learning)

### A Brief History of AI

- 40's -  A simple model of the neuron introduced by McCulloh and Pitt as a summing and thresholding device
- 1950 -- Alan Turing defines a test for intelligence based on conversation via text interface
- Dartmouth Conference 1956 -- the birth of AI -- Minsky, McCarthy
